# MonsterDuelDice
My first unity game demo which produced after I learnt code one semester.

This is a game which I designed when I was in primary school. When I try to make it out, I only learn IT not too long time. So I only consider how to make this game be smaller but not take maintainance into account.

And that time, I didn't know too much about algorithm. The most difficult algorithm in this demo is only A* and some bad structures which contains almost all information of all monsters.

I should not make a gaem as framework as this anymore. But I truly learn a lot when I try to do this game. I learned a lot of different things of Unity and try them into this game. So this is a `laboratory` actually.
