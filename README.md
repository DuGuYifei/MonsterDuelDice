A unity 3D game demo of a SRPG game played by throwing dice.

Because I only learn IT little time when I try to make it out, I only consider how to make this game be smaller but not take too much of add additional animations into account. Therefore, the framework is not suitable for teamwork, I should not use this way anymore.
