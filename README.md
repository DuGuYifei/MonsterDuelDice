My first unity game demo which produced after I learnt code one semester.

This is a game which I designed when I was in primary school. When I try to make it out, I only learn IT not too long time. So I only consider how to make this game be smaller but not take too much of maintainance into account.

So the framework is not suitable for teamwork, I should not use this way anymore.
